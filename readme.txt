Learned things: positioning, centering divs, displays, making scalable css, prioritize css over JS, 
css functions for responsiveness, css variables â€” despite not using it here, inset, margin, using translates,
background image, BEM, text responsiveness, and using intersection observer: the one watching intersections 
between user view and a box. I started using more pseudo selectors such as ~, ::before, and the padding property.
Next time I will use variables. That would make searching for properties a lot easier and less time consuming.

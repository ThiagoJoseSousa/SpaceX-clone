# SpaceX clone

## Description
This project displays a responsive and beautiful layout that contains many animations that ease the user experience. The looks are reusable, and the website could be expanded vertically forever.
I first tried making a SpaceX Clone to study APIs, and, despite I concluded the project, my CSS got very dirty. In this project, my goal was specific to CSS, and Javascript entered the project just for adding classes on scroll.

# SpaceX clone

## Description
This project displays a responsive and beautiful layout that contains many animations that ease the user experience. The looks are reusable, and the website could be expanded vertically forever.
I first tried making a SpaceX Clone to study the Wiki API, and, despite I concluded the [project](https://github.com/ThiagoJoseSousa/spacex-page-wiki-api), my CSS got very dirty. In this project, my goal was specific to CSS, and Javascript entered the project just for adding classes on scroll.

## How to use
You can either click [here](https://spacex-uiclone.netlify.app/) to acess, or download the project and open the HTML file.

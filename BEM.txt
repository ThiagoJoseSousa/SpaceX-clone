IDs are required for using JavaScript.
Modern browsers can work with either IDs or classes. Any type of selector is processed at the same rate in the browser.
IDs are used with the <label> tag.
If you place <label> inside a control, it doesnâ€™t need an ID. Instead of <input id="ID"><label for="ID">Text</label>, simply use <label><input type="...">Text</label>.
